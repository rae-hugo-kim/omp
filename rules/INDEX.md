# INDEX.md (rules)

## Ownership legend

- `owner: global-harness` → enforced by oh-my-claudecode platform/harness.
- `owner: local-policy` → enforced by this repository’s policy docs and review process.
- Any `MUST` without an explicit owner tag defaults to `owner: local-policy` unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Conflict resolution order (when global and local diverge)

1. **System/developer/user instructions** (runtime prompt instructions)
2. **Global harness requirements** (`owner: global-harness`)
3. **Repository-local policy** (`owner: local-policy`)
4. **Advisory guidance** (`SHOULD` / `MAY`)

If a local policy conflicts with a global harness rule, follow the global harness rule and document the deviation.
If both global and local guidance exist for the same tool choice, apply global-harness rules first, then local policy ordering.
